                <h2>1. The Idea</h2>
                <p>
                    The initial idea for this project was to create a <strong>custom music player</strong> that allows users to upload and play audio files directly from their computer. 
                    I aimed to combine my passion for frontend development with a practical, interactive application. The goal was to provide a simple, responsive music player with features like play/pause, volume control, and a dynamic playlist.

                <h2>2. The Design Process</h2>
                <p>
                    The design was initially focused on a clean and minimalistic user interface with a <strong>dark mode</strong> theme. I used HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the interactive elements. My goal was to make the player intuitive, so I focused on user-friendly controls like play/pause buttons and volume sliders.
                </p>
                <p><code>Example: <br> &lt;button id="play-btn"&gt;Play&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>

            <!-- Challenges Section -->
            <div id="challenges" class="phase">
                <h2>3. The Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major challenges I faced was handling file uploads. Initially, the player had trouble reading and playing the audio files. Using the <code>FileReader API</code>, I was able to ensure the player could load and play local files correctly. Another challenge was implementing <strong>localStorage</strong> to preserve the playlist even after a page refresh, which required working with JavaScript to save and load the playlist data.
                </p>
                <p><code>Example: <br> localStorage.setItem('playlist', JSON.stringify(playlist));</code></p>
                <img src="images/2024-11-23.png" alt="Screenshot showing error handling and file upload process" class="phase-image">
            </div>
            
            <!-- Benefits Section -->
            <div id="benefits" class="phase">
                <h2>4. Benefits and Outcome</h2>
                <p>
                    Completing this project not only gave me a valuable addition to my portfolio but also taught me new skills. I gained hands-on experience working with JavaScript for file handling, implementing the <code>Web Audio API</code>, and storing data with <strong>localStorage</strong>. The end result is a fully functional, aesthetically pleasing music player that allows users to interact with their personal music library seamlessly.

                <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    This project helped me grow as a developer by pushing me to solve real-world problems, from working with browser APIs to creating a smooth and interactive user interface. I'm proud of the final product, and it showcases my ability to turn an idea into a fully developed application.
